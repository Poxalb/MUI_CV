# MUI_CV
Note: I have done this curriculum as if I was in a fantasy world, is my way to be creative hope you like it 😁


    Target User: I intend on using a spell to let all guilds and taverns know about my prowess in my job. So that anyone (with the coin) can contact me for my services.

    Color Palette: I've used some brown tones (rgb(161, 112, 51) for the main piece, rgb(140, 79, 5) for the laterals and rgb(122, 55, 0) for top and bottom parts) because they feel kind of like a tavern. I wanted proximity with my clients and I feel this gives a hearthy welcome to anyone who would see it.
    I've used the default (no modification in css) font, I tried some gothic fonts but I didn't get to see one i liked.
    The layout you see is a combination from various ones I saw while researching, at last when I started with Figma I loved the idea that it could look like a window.
    And the image I used is an avatar, is supposed to be the typical photo of the CV.
